GET is like asking for information:
We tell the server what you want by tacking on some details in the website address. Everyone can see these details, so it's like shouting your request across the room.

Example:
vbnet
Copy code
Hey, give me /example?name=value&key=123!
POST is like giving information:

In post: Instead of shouting across the room, you hand a note to the server. The details are hidden in the note, so it's more private.

Example:
rust
Copy code
Here's a note for you. It says, name=value&key=123.

OAuth:
OAuth, or Open Authorization, is a standard protocol used for secure and delegated authorization. In simpler terms, it's a way for you to grant a third-party application or service limited access to your resources without sharing your credentials (like your username and password). 

Note:Sir/mam'am I have done 1st API and 2nd API I wasn't able to do due fully due to my ongoing examination. I will do it as soon as my examination gets over.
